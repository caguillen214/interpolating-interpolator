Angular Hint: Interpolation [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/caguillen214/interpolating-interpolator.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/caguillen214/interpolating-interpolator)
==================

Angular Hint Interpolation lets you spend less time finding silent errors in your code and more time on actually programming. This tool is a subset of many under the [Angular Hint](https://github.com/angular/angular-hint) repository that specializes in identifying errors relating to interpolations. For instructions on how to incorporate the whole Angular Hint repository into your project, please refer to the link above.

Angular Hint Interpolation notifies you of any interpolation that evaluates to undefined. In the code below, if the interpolation in the source of the image was undefined, we would would end up with 'imgs/users/.png'. With Hint Interpolation one would immediately know that the interpolation was undefined and wouldn't have to wonder as to why their image wasn't displaying.

```
<img ng-src='imgs/users/{{user.name}}.png'/>
```

Additionally, Hint Interpolation addresses the problem of identifying where in chain the object becomes undefined when evaluating values deep within nested object. For example, imagine the scenario below where you have a chain of values from an api and you need to get to the url of a tweet. If any of the values in the chain do not exsist because of a typo, index out of bounds, etc. you would get an empty string returned and you wouldn't know where your code went awry. Hint Interpolation would notify you that 'data.results[0].url' was found to be undefined in the interpolation 'data.results[0].url[0].url'.
```
<a ngHref = '{{data.results[0].url[0].url'>Link to Tweet</a>
```
```
data = {
  "completed_in":0.031,
  "refresh_url":"?since_id=122078461840982016&q=blue%20angels",
  "results":[
    {
      "entities":{
        "urls":[
          {
            "url":"http://t.co/L9JXJ2ee",
            "expanded_url":"http://bit.ly/q9fyz9",
            "display_url":"bit.ly/q9fyz9",
            "indices":[
              37,
              57
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }]
}
```
